## 📝 Introduction

This is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports multiple users joining a room to work on the same piece of code collaboratively. Users can edit, run, and compile code simultaneously in real time.

It offers AI assistance to review code for optimizations, improve readability, and detect potential errors. The platform supports multiple programming languages to facilitate diverse development needs.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧑‍💻 **Real-Time Collaboration**
Multiple users can join a shared code room and collaborate live via WebSockets.

### 💡 **AI Code Review**
Integrated Gemini API to analyze and suggest best practices, optimizations, and improvements.

### ⚙️ **Multi-Language Code Execution**
Supports real-time code execution in C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript using the Piston API.

### 📡 **Room Management with Socket.IO**
Users can join/leave rooms and sync code edits with real-time accuracy.

### 🌐 **Modern Tech Stack**
Built with a clean and responsive UI, and a scalable backend for a seamless experience.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Guide to Use

**Step 1:**  
Go to the website and create a room. Copy the Room ID and share it with your friends so they can join the session.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer       | Technologies                                      |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**| React.js, JavaScript, CSS, Socket.IO              |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO                    |
| **APIs Used** | [Piston API](https://github.com/engineer-man/piston), [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) |
| **Others**  | Vite, Nodemon, Axios                              |

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User joins a room via a unique **Room ID**.
2. The code editor is synced across users using **Socket.IO**.
3. Code can be written and executed instantly via the **Piston API**.
4. An **AI Review** can be triggered using the **Gemini API** to receive feedback on code quality, structure, and optimizations.
